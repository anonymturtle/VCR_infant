# Visual Category Representations in the Infant Brain
This repository provides MATLAB example codes used in the study "Visual category representations in the infant brain (_"VCR_infant"_ in short)". 

On terminal, clone this repository to local:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/anonymturtle/VCR_infant.git
```

## Demo codes
**IMPORTANT: To run the demo codes, a [LIBSVM] toolbox is required. Please see the "Dependency" and "Installation" sections for details.** 

Here are six examples corresponding to the six main analyses in the study.

- Decode object categories in time (runtime: ~ 2 min) 
    ```sh
    example_decodingintime.m
    ```
- Decode object categories in time and frequency (runtime: ~ 5 min) 
    ```sh
    example_decodingtimefrequency.m
    ```
- Time generalization analysis (runtime: ~ 1 min) 
    ```sh
    example_decodingtimegeneralization.m 
    ```
- Relate category representations in infants and adults (runtime: ~ 1 min) 
    ```sh
    example_rsatimegeneralization.m 
    ```
- Relate oscillation-based category representations in infants and adults (runtime: ~ 1 min) 
    ```sh
    example_rsatimefrequency.m
    ```
- Relate category representations to computational models* (runtime: ~ 1 min) 
    ```sh
    example_rsatomodels.m
    ```
_*Gabor filter model and VGG-19 deep neural network trained on object categorization_

## Dependency
The demo codes have the dependencies described below. You must download (or clone) these repositories and ensure that they are on your Matlab path.

| Resource/Software | Source/Identifier |
| ------ | ------ |
| Example data* | [https://osf.io/ruxfg] |
| LIBSVM toolbox♰ | [https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm; RRID: SCR_010243] |

_* This item will be automatically downloaded to your path while running the demo codes (via ```setup.m```) if it has not already been downloaded._

_♰ This item needs to be downloaded and installed manually. (See "Installation" for details.)_

## Installation
Demo codes require [LIBSVM] (e.g., version-3.25) toolbox to run.
- On terminal, clone the [LIBSVM.git] repository to _/code_ directory.
    ```sh
    cd VCR_infant/code
    git clone https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm.git
    ```
- If you are on Unix systems, you will need to compile the toolbox. Please rely on the steps in [LIBSVM.readme].
    <details><summary>A quick walk-through:</summary>
    <p>   

    - On MATLAB command window, type:
    ``` sh
    >> cd libsvm/matlab
    >> matlabroot % check your $MATLABROOT
    >> edit Makefile 
    ```
    - On MATLAB editor, manually edit the "Makefile":
    ```sh
    a) In line:3, change the "MATLABDIR ?= " to your $MATLABROOT 
    b) save the "Makefile"
    ```
    - Back on MATLAB command window, type:
    ``` sh
    >> make % it will take a few seconds to compile 
    ```
    _For more details, please see [LIBSVM.readme]._
